# 👋 Hi, I’m Jerin James

🧠 Software Developer · 📱 Flutter-first · ⚙️ Backend & Systems-oriented

I build mobile applications with Flutter and spend a lot of time working on backend systems, databases, and networking.  
I care more about **how things work** than how flashy they look — reliability, clarity, and scalability matter to me.

I currently work as a **LIMS Developer**, and most of my learning happens by building and refining real systems.

## 🛠️ Tools I Use Daily
🧰 Git · GitHub · VS Code · Android Studio · DBeaver · SQL Workbench  
🧰 Visual Studio · Eclipse · Backend CLIs & DB tools

---

## 🧠 How I Approach Development
- backend and business logic first  
- simple, maintainable solutions  
- strong interest in protocols & networking behavior  
- UI/UX matters — but correctness and system design matter more  

I use AI where it makes sense (especially UI/UX) so I can focus on architecture, logic, and data flow.

## 🚧 What I’m Learning
📐 System design and architectural trade-offs  
⚙️ Backend performance & database internals  
🔍 Building more observable, resilient systems  

---

## 🧪 Projects & Focus Areas
Most repositories here are **real, evolving projects**, not demos.

🔹 Flutter tools & developer utilities  
🔹 Backend wiring & CLI-style workflows  
🔹 **Hive-Mind** — a platform for students & hardware enthusiasts to work with hardware remotely without touching low-level code  
🔹 Upcoming testing & analytics platforms  
🔹 Several niche, near-production applications  

If you’re a Flutter developer — you’ll find practical tools here.

## 🎯 I Care About
- writing maintainable code  
- understanding how things work under the hood  
- building software that actually solves problems
